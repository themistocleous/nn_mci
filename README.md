# Prerequisites
This project requires scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, data are analyzed using NumPy, pandas, and visualize with Matplotlib. Most of these packages are included in the Anaconda Environment. 

To Install Anaconda, please visit the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for instructions. 

To install [Keras]

> conda install -c keras

# Development
The original code was written using Jupyter Notebooks. The current form is employed 

# Data Availability
The data contain information about patients' productions that may be employed to identify the patients. Therefore, they cannot be released in this project, based on the Ethics Agreement. Nevertheless, you may use the code using your own data.

# Ethics
Ethic approvals for the study were obtained by the local ethical committee review board (reference number: L091-99, 1999; T479-11, 2011); while the currently described study was approved by the local ethical committee decision 206-16, 2016.
